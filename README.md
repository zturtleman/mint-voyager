Incomplete **Spearmint Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force Holomatch (multiplayer)** game code. This is a reimplementation of the Holomatch code as the original code is under an incompatible license. A lot of things look or behave wrong (such as the weapons).

mint-voyager code commits: [compare/upstream...master](https://github.com/zturtleman/mint-voyager/compare/upstream...master)

To use this you'll need the [Spearmint engine](https://github.com/clover-moe/spearmint).

  * On Windows, install [Cygwin and mingw-w64](https://github.com/clover-moe/spearmint/wiki/Compiling#windows).
  * Get the source for Spearmint and build it using `make`.
  * Get the source for this repo and build it using `make`.
  * Copy baseEF/pak0.pk3 into the baseef directory in `mint-voyager/build/release-mingw32-x86/`.
  * Copy the [spearmint-patch-data](https://github.com/clover-moe/spearmint-patch-data) for baseef there too.

If you put both projects in the same directory you can launch the game using;

    spearmint/build/release-mingw32-x86/spearmint_x86.exe +set fs_basepath "mint-voyager/build/release-mingw32-x86/" +set fs_game "baseef"

On Linux and OS X you'll need to put `./` before the command and substitute the correct platform and architecture (look in the build directory).
